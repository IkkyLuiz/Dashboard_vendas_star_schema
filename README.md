Creating a dimensional model in the form of a star schema centered on professors involves defining the fact table and the associated dimension tables. Below is a breakdown of how you can structure the model:

### Star Schema Design

#### Fact Table: `Fact_Professor_Analysis`

**Granularity**: Each record represents a course taught by a professor in a specific semester.

| Column Name          | Data Type    | Description                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fact_ID              | Integer      | Unique identifier for the fact record                       |
| Professor_ID         | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the `Dimension_Professor` table     |
| Course_ID            | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the `Dimension_Course` table        |
| Department_ID        | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the `Dimension_Department` table    |
| Date_ID              | Integer      | Foreign key referencing the `Dimension_Date` table          |
| Hours_Taught         | Decimal      | Total hours taught by the professor for the course          |
| Course_Enrollment     | Integer      | Number of students enrolled in the course                   |
| Course_Rating        | Decimal      | Average rating of the course as provided by students        |

### Relationships

- The **Fact_Professor_Analysis** table will link to:
  - **Dimension_Professor** via `Professor_ID`
  - **Dimension_Course** via `Course_ID`
  - **Dimension_Department** via `Department_ID`
  - **Dimension_Date** via `Date_ID`

### Summary

This star schema is designed to facilitate analysis of professors, including metrics like teaching hours, course enrollment, and course ratings, while also providing contextual information through dimensions related to professors, courses, departments, and dates. This model will support various analytical queries, such as performance metrics of professors across different courses and departments, while providing flexibility in reporting over time.
